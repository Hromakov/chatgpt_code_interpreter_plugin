Provide the code as a plain text string, without any triple quotes or additional comments. Make sure that the code is indented correctly and follows Python's indentation rules. Avoid any extra characters or symbols that are not part of the code. If the code contains quotation marks, make sure to escape them using a backslash (\\) to prevent any conflicts with the JSON format.
